# DNN_project
This Repository consists of DeepNeuralNetworks(DNN) models that we as a team of 3 have implemented(but this git consists of my models only). I will add a seperate file explaning How I coded Helmholtz Machine I need some time.Since,I have major exams near(26/05/2025) after that I will make a video* and brief document .Which can help those who want to learn how to do code Helmholtz Machine.


*Video not sure (afraid) but try my best to make
